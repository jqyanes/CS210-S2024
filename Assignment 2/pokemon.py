# [10 pts] Fill in the missing "type" column values (given by NaN) by mapping them 
    # from the corresponding "weakness" values. You will see that typically a given pokemon weakness 
    # has a fixed "type", but there are some exceptions. So, fill in the "type" column with 
    # the most common "type" corresponding to the pokemonâ€™s "weakness" value.
# For example, most of the pokemons having the weakness "electric" are "water" type pokemons 
    # but there are other types too that have "electric" as their weakness (exceptions in that "type"). 
    # But since "water" is the most common type for weakness "electric", it should be filled in.
# In case of a tie, use the type that appears first in alphabetical order.

# [13 pts] Fill in the missing (NaN) values in the Attack ("atk"), Defense ("def") 
    # and Hit Points ("hp") columns as follows:
# Set the pokemon level threshold to 40.
# For a Pokemon having level above the threshold (i.e. > 40), fill in the missing value for atk/def/hp 
    # with the average values of atk/def/hp of Pokemons with level > 40. 
    # So, for instance, you would substitute the missing "atk" value for Magmar (level 44), 
    # with the average "atk" value for Pokemons with level > 40. Round the average to one decimal place.
    # For a Pokemon having level equal to or below the threshold (i.e. <= 40), 
    # fill in the missing value for atk/def/hp with the average values of atk/def/hp of Pokemons 
    # with level <= 40. Round the average to one decimal place. 
# After performing #2 and #3, write the modified data to another csv file named "pokemonResult.csv".
# This result file should have all of the rows from the input file - rows that were modified 
    # as well as rows that were not modified.
# If you do not write the modified data to another CSV file, or your output file name is not 
    # exactly as required, you will get 0 points.
